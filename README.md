# SMART FIRE DETECTION AND ALARM SYSTEM
Mini project based on IOT 
#Housefires occur in houses mostly in the kitchens and bedrooms. It leads to damage of the property 
and also lives. In order to avoid that or to minimize the damage caused by a fire outbreak an IOT 
(Internet Of Things) technology is used to control such a kind of risk. NodeMCU based IoT fire 
detector is one of the solutions we implemented for this kind of issue. In this model, we have fitted 
a fire indicator by making practical and effective use of NodeMCU which is connected with a 
flame sensor and buzzer along with LED’s. Flame sensor is most sensitive to normal light. That’s 
why this sensor module is used in flame alarms. Buzzer interfaced with it makes an alert sound 
and lights also blink along with them. The response of these sensors is faster as well as more 
accurate compared with a heat/smoke detector because of its mechanism while detecting the 
flame. The buzzer stops itself at whatever point the temperature falls to comfortable indoor 
temperature and the amount of heat decreases. NodeMCU fire finder serves best because at 
whatever point it indicates fire or smoke, then it immediately alarms the admin or user about the 
fire through the SMS that is sent using the Blynk application. The device can be switched on and 
off using Google assistant using the “Switch on” and “Switch Off” commands “Connecting Blynk 
with Google assistant using IFTTT”. At whatever point a fire happens, the user gets the alert 
notification through smartphone.
